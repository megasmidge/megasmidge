I bit the bullet and installed Fedora on my tower. I mirrored everything I did on the XPS-15, including the setup for DBD, and it ran just terribly. It has something to do with the Nvidia drivers not playing well with Fedora. The GPU is an RTX 2060, but that's way better than an integrated graphics driver on a laptop, or so I thought. Launching DBD took forever. I tried several YouTube videos and tutorials explaining how to install the drivers on Fedora, but each attempt ended worse than the one before it. I ended up throwing in the towel and rolling the dice with a Debian distribution, Pop OS! Surprisingly, it worked like a charm, if a charm didn't need Secure Boot enabled. I'm at peace with it. DBD runs smooth and fast like I am used to. So now I have Pop OS on the tower, Fedora on the Dell XPS laptop, and I put Windows 11 on the spare laptop if I need to do any FiveM testing. 

Dead by Daylight just put out some Developer notes concerning the upcoming patch. They are nerfing the "Eruption" killer perk, and buffing the "Any Means Necessary" perk. They plan to improve their custom-game AI bots, and also eliminate someone getting the same map twice in-a-row unless someone brings a map offering. The community seems to be reacting well to the announced future changes. Honestly, it's just nice to see that the devs are listening, regardless of how folks feel about a specific change, they are listening. There was also a teaser trailer for the next chapter. People are already speculating that we're getting the Terminator as a new killer, but I seriously doubt that. The intellectual property behind that license is so large that we would have heard about it by now. Regardless of who or what the new chapter is, I'm excited for it!

Changing subjects, we just watched the second episode of MTV's The Challenge Season 38 Finale (yes the finale is at least 3 episodes long). I have to be honest, while this is undeniably the longest final they've ever done ("100 hrs"), it doesn't feel like the hardest final they've ever done. I don't know if something is getting lost in editing, or if the first 4 hours being traveling left a sour taste in my mouth. It's clearly a difficult endeavor, but honestly previous seasons feel like they were more intense. They've had 2 eating challenges already, so I know it's tough as I am a notoriously picky eater, but they are letting them sleep at night. I wonder if they adjusted things because certain contestants got injured and had to leave mid-finale. I'm just not excited or rooting for anyone, which is never what you want when you're indulging in reality competition shows.

Netflix dropped a new season (or at least new episodes) of their show "You." I haven't had a chance to watch it yet, but that's the big thing in the queue this month along side HBO's "The Last of Us." My wife also binged "Friends from College," and after catching the last few episodes, I enjoyed a few laughs. 

That's all I have for today. The US shot down something over Alaska, Coronavirus is surging 3 years later, and Fedora doesn't jive with Nvidia. Hug those close to you work to live. Have a good weekend.
